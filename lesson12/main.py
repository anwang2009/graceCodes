Lesson 12: Combining lists
"""

# Write a function that concatenates two lists and returns
# the resulting list. For example:
# ["a","b","c"], [1,2,3] → ["a","b","c",1,2,3]


# Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly
# taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3].
# If the length of the lists is not the same, raise a ValueError

# Extra: Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a
# new sorted list. For example,
# [1,4,6],[2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]
