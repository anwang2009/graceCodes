# TODO (2): Create a function that has no arguments
# that prints "Hello world!" when called.


# TODO (3): Create a function that has no arguments
# that introduces yourself when called.


# TODO (4): Create a function that has one integer argument
# that does the following:
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that
# are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9.
# The sum of these multiples is 23.
# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5
# below the provided argument n. Return this sum.


# TODO (5): Create a function that takes one string argument.
# The provided argument will be a name. When called the
# function should print "Good job, An!" if called with "An". 


# TODO (6): Create a function that takes two integer arguments
# x and y. The function should return the minimum of the two
# arguments. 



# TODO (1): How do you define a "main" function (the desired 
# entry point of a script) in python? You can refer to past
# files for examples of this.
# 
# In Java, main looks like:
#    public static void main(String args[]) {}
# In C, main looks like either of the following:
#    int main() {}
#    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {}
# 
# Your completed main function should call the functions
# you define in the other TODOs.
#    2. Call the function
#    3. Call the function
#    4. Call the function with argument 1000 and print the result
#    5. Call the function with argument "Grace"
#    6. Call the function with arguments 2 and 3 and print the result
