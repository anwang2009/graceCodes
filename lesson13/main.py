Lesson 13: 2D arrays
"""

# Warmup: Write a function that prints the first n prime numbers, where n
# is given as an argument


# Write a function "init_2D" that constructs and returns a list that contains three lists.
# Each inner list has three numbers. Each number from 1 to 9 inclusive should be
# represented.


# Write a function "print_2D" that displays a given argument "list2D".
# Python will print [['x', 'y', ['x','y'], ['x', 'y']] as [[x, y], [x, y], [x, y]] but
# we want the output
# xy
# xy
# xy
