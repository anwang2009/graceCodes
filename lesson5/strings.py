Lesson 5: Doing stuff with strings
"""

# TODO 2: Define a function more_consonants that takes a string and
# returns True if the string has more consonants
# than vowels.


# TODO 3: Define a function is_palindrome that takes a string and
# returns True if the string is a palindrome,
# and False otherwise.


# TODO 4: Define a function `matches` that takes two strings and
# returns True if the strings match each other in the following
# way: '*' represents any single character.
# a*rdvark matches aardvark
# hi matches hi
# *i matches h*
# ol* doesn't match el*
# **** matches ****
# *** doesn't match *
# Returns False if the strings don't match


# TODO 1: Write the main entry point that calls the
# following functions with a few test cases each:
# - is_palindrome
# - more_consonants
# - matches
# 
# Hint: You can print the result of each test, or you can use
# the keyword `assert`, which expects the expression after it to
# evaluate to True
# 
# Printing:
#    result = is_palindrome("racecar")
#    print("is_palindrome of racecar is", result)
#
# Asserting:
#    assert is_palindrome("racecar")
#    assert not is_palindrome("not a palindrome haha")
